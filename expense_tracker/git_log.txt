    For the MVC architecture pattern, the Observer design pattern will now be used to update the View after the Model is manipulated by the Controller. Started to modify the Model to be the Observable. Added the ExpenseTrackerModelListener interface to be the Observer interface. Modified the ExpenseTrackerView class to be a concrete Observer class. Started to modify the Controller class to apply this pattern. For test driven development, modified the test suite to add the register test cases. One of them is currently failing.
